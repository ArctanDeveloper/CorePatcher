A simple mod that allows easy assembly patching for Terraria. 
Originally was part of my Infinite world mod, I decided to make this a proper library instead.
This is not beginner friendly; it will require you to know how to do advanced IL editing.

This also will write to your disk the patched assembly as "tModLoader.patched.dll".
Any harm caused by other mods using this mod is not my responsibility, but the responsibility of you and the mods doing the harm.

Once the patching is done, go in your Steam folder and rename "tModLoader.patched.dll" to "tModloader.dll", and check if your change applied properly with ILSpy.
Automatically reloading the game will be added later.

Strongly recommend reading this and practicing IL before using this:

Wiki on how to use this will come soon. For now, check the example provided here:
https://github.com/Dradonhunter11/CorePatcher/blob/master/Examples/ExamplePatch.cs

Features to come:
- Allow dependency injection (while this is technically possible, "tModLoader.deps.json" still needs to be edited to launch the game properly).
- Automatically restart the game once the patching is done.
