Simple mod that allow easy assembly patching for terraria. 
This is not begineer friendly, it will require you to know how to do advanced IL editing.

This also will write on your disk the written assembly as "tModLoader.patched.dll".
Any harm caused by other mods using this mod is not my responsability but the responsability of you and the mods doing the harm.

Strongly recommend reading this and practicing IL before using this:
